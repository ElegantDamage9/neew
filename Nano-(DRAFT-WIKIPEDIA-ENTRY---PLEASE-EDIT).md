# Nano

Nano is a peer-to-peer cryptocurrency designed to be low-latency, scalable and power efficient ([1](https://nano.org/en/whitepaper)).

## History

Nano (NANO) (formerly RaiBlocks with ticker XRB) had it's first alpha release in November 2014 ([2](https://github.com/nanocurrency/raiblocks/releases/tag/VERSION_1)), with a beta ([3](https://github.com/nanocurrency/raiblocks/releases/tag/V3.0.0)) and paper ([4](https://nano.org/en/whitepaper)) following shortly after in December 2014.

## Distribution

Nano was originally distributed to people via a digital faucet which went live in October 2015 ([5](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/raiblocks/OmoQ88MhE5s)). To receive coins, users would need to complete a captcha and would receive coins sent to their unique public address. 

The faucet was shutdown sometime in October 2017 and the remaining coin supply was burned, leaving a circulating supply of 133,248,289 NANO ([6](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/nano/)).

## Price rise

In January 2018, Nano caught the attention of mainstream media along with a number of other cryptocurrencies due to a recent large price spike ([7](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/01/29/2018-might-be-the-year-of-the-great-crypto-rotation-tom-lee.html)).

## Rebranding

On the 31st January 2018, RaiBlocks was renamed to Nano and another 20% price rise followed ([8](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jessedamiani/2018/01/31/raiblocks-rebrands-to-nano-xrb-price-has-surged-41-in-24-hours-with-20-bull-run-this-morning/#22d94871567a)).

## BitGrail

On Friday, 9th February, an Italian cryptocurrency exchange that had previously been one of the few trading the Nano cryptocurrency announced that they had been hacked and over 10% of Nano's total circulating supply had been stolen from their exchange ([8](https://techcrunch.com/2018/02/12/bitgrail-hack-nano/)).
